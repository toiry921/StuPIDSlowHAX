# StuPIDSlowHAX
Implementation of the veryslowpidhax shown [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws#Kernel11) given a new title because it sounds better as it is stupidly slow.

As of this time I'm not sure how well this implementation works or if it even works at all. If this does work this should give access to all the services listed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Services_API).

This was just a project I completed in a very minimal amount of time so the code is probably messy and most likely incomplete. Most of the code is based on others work where I just implemented the execution

# How to use
Download the precompiled binaries or just compile from source
then open up homebrew
then run the StuPIDSlowHax.3dsx
wait for the exploit to complete
then you should be able to return to the homebrew launcher and load up something that uses the services

# How Long to Execute
As it is Stupidly slow it takes in my estimates about 2 weeks to complete, but that is just an estimate using my math skills so it has the posibility of taking longer or shorter but most likely longer.

# FAQ
Q: What Firmware Versions does this work on?

A: Works™ on all system versions at this time (12/13/16)

Q: Why would I use this?

A: Not sure, you might just like the pain of waiting and not being able to use a 3ds for a few weeks

Q: What use is this to me

A: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Q: Will you be updating this?

A: Nope, I personally won't be working on this but feel free to make a Pull Request to fix my work
